So I am trying to get gTTS to work
I know that you are supposed to import with from gtts import gTTS.
I have a new virtualenv, with gtts, and speechrecognition installed and no matter what I do I can't get gTTS to import
If I try: from gtts import gTTS
ImportError: cannot import name 'gTTS'
Any ideas?
